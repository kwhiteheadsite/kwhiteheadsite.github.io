<h1>A Quarter Tab of Loss</h1>
<p>She opens the door—in full Insta-ready make up, waist-length hair
tied in a neat ponytail, hoop earrings, dressed in the latest trendy
togs from some vendor of fast fashion—then disappears straightaway to
her bedroom. I can visualise it, so neat, so orderly, almost purely
white, decked out in Ikea with little trinkets and pink accents, the
dressing table where she experiments with adulthood. She’ll be doing
homework, probably, or texting with friends, or checking her mascara,
the mysterious tasks required to fashion a separate self, and I will be
left wondering: how can she already be almost 14?</p>
<p>Later, I’ll see her in snatches—laying the table, complaining as she
mucks out the animal hutches, or playing with her young cousins, my
kids. At mealtimes, I try to ask questions and really listen to the
answers, but it will feel thin, cursory, too shallow—and at the same
time, too intense, too pressured, by the brevity of our time
together—and I am rarely able to get beneath the respectable, rote chat
of subject choices or her quasi-coy, quasi-proud, always offhand talk of
boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Before I had kids of my own, I’d always prided myself on my relationship
with my niece. I found her inspiring. Literally. For years, I had
struggled with writer’s block; after visiting Laney as a toddler, I
would write for hours. I felt through her I had a stake in a future that
I’d never really imagined before: a young person is an envoy from the
future, a way to imagine the future.</p>
<p>The queer theorist Lee Edelman has spoken of this negatively, how the
child represents specifically ‘the possibility of the future against
which the queer is positioned as the embodiment of a relentlessly
narcissistic, antisocial, and future-negating drive.’ But someone else’s
child embodies the possibility of the future without endorsing it. If
the relationship between a mother and child is heteronormative,
conservative, and prosocial, there’s something potentially queer and
radical about the relationship between an aunt and her niece.</p>
<p>I remember when Laney was born, I felt obligation and responsibility,
but they were light, manageable burdens. I thought I could be like a dad
to her—not a great dad, by any means— but certainly as present and
reliable as many actual dads. Leslie Jamison says of travelling with her
baby, ‘I can be the father who goes away, and the mother who stays.’
There is immense power—creative, especially—in being the father. The
father is the one who gives what he can, who takes what he needs. Who
leaves.</p>
<p>In truth I was naïve. Once I entered a new relationship when Laney
was two, I started to get giddy, greedy. To imagine a Laney of my own,
as though it was as easy as that. As though a Laney grows on trees. My
monthly visits were like microdosing parenthood. All the joy of being
loved unconditionally—all the therapeutic benefits—with none of the
exhaustion.</p>
<p>And now, with a two- and a five-year-old, the microdoses aren’t
having their effect. I’ve ODed on the heavier stuff. My own children
pull at me, my breast, my mind, they want things I feel incapable of. A
constant need for—I can’t even finish the thought half the time.</p>
<p>When Laney comes down and takes them to play a game of ‘hide the
pompoms’, I crash on the couch, mindlessly scrolling through my phone,
like a pig truffling, for articles with adult intelligence. I want to be
present in the moment with my niece, but I want this more. A long read,
a murder mystery, incisive literary criticism. For half an hour, or an
hour, my dilettantism at adulthood, will be eclipsed by Laney’s
radiance, her expertise at care and play.</p>
<p>I feel sad that I can’t be as present for Laney, moment to moment, as
I was, but I also feel the loss on a grander scale.</p>
<p>When I was 16, I went to stay with my aunt, my mother’s sister, for
two weeks. The pretext was to attend a nearby drama school. Privately I
suspected that my parents’ marriage was going through a rocky patch, but
I suppose a more innocent interpretation was that they just needed a
break. Also, my aunt had cancer.</p>
<p>In the time I stayed with her, I grew huge crushes, ignited several
romantic entanglements that would keep my heart broken for months if not
years on end, did an audition of <em>All the Worlds a Stage</em> wearing
a black velvet dress, holding a cigarette lighter, affecting the air of
weary indifference that would eventually become my brand, and somehow
got cast as the courtesan in an abbreviated <em>Comedy of Errors</em>.
My aunt took me to a pub quiz, and I told her she was too competitive.
When I got home from rehearsals, I’d drink green tea and eat chocolate
cake that my aunt had bought to wean me off from pure chocolate and
sleep in a box room beneath a shelf of books. Those two weeks were a
capsule of discovery, and I loved everything about it, learning
independence in baby steps. Stepping away from my parents, under the
wry, loving, knowing, eye of my aunt. Two years later, she was dead.</p>
<p>I always imagined I’d have Laney to stay when she turned 16, install
her in some course or other. A rite of passage; also, a way to honour my
aunt. But that is just two years from now. I didn’t realise everything
would be back to front, her mum the single mother and my kids so little
still. So draining.</p>
<p>One time she adds me on TikTok. The rich deflation I feel when I see
it’s so I can help her win something.</p>
<p>OMG I WOULD DIE FOR ALL THIS STUFF YOU’RE SO KINDDDD @kitA DONE XXXX

<p>I find myself thinking of the day she was born, getting Dominos
delivered to the hospital, not realising that the cheesy stodge was the
last thing her mother might want—after the long induction, the difficult
birth, the moment the cord got caught around Laney’s neck.</p>
<p>I remember driving so carefully over the speedbumps away from the
hospital, my sister and our precious cargo in the back seat.</p>
<p>My sister had given birth without a birthing partner, a decision I
couldn’t understand at the time—I would have been there in an instant
had she asked—but later I understood how the most useful person to be in
the room was already there. My sister didn’t need anyone else to
motivate her. She had Laney.</p>
<p>That first day home, I took care of Laney whilst her mother showered,
placing her between my legs on the couch and sketching her. A baby is
the smallest unit of human, and you feel it, it’s there in the soft
curly hands, the blinky eyelids. I hadn’t planned to make art; it was a
spontaneous reaction to the urgency of my feelings. Like Wittgenstein
(quoted by Elaine Scarry) says, ‘when the eye sees something beautiful,
the hand wants to draw it.’</p>
<p>Later, after I left them, I worried so badly that my sister with her
weak ankles would stumble in the night and drop her. I worried the next
night, and the night after. I didn’t realise this long-range terror,
these jagged imaginings, were the birth pains of a new sort of love.</p>
<p>There is supposed to be anxiety in the gift giving—to gift is to
risk. The chance to say this is how I see you, am I close? But now when
Christmas, or her birthday swings around, I get specific Amazon
instructions, totalling almost exactly the £25 I’ve budgeted to spend.
It feels more like admin than caring. I don’t pay extra to get them
wrapped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, after she was visibly unhappy with her eyebrows and the
pencil she’d used, I broke our family’s agreed budget and bought a Boy
Brow stick from Glossier. ‘Do you know what that is?’ I asked, needily.
‘Oh yeah,’ she mumbled, then something like ‘fancy.’ One time I sent her
an un-asked for a chess set. It got lost for months in the post. And
even though it wasn’t my fault, it felt symbolic of something. That she
could no longer depend on me. That my love had faltered, the capacity of
love that had compelled me that first day to sketch her—because art, as
Lewis Hyde says, is a gift too—had stuttered over time, had become too
diffuse, too widely spread, diluted by more pressing commitments.</p>
<p>I have a gif on my phone from 2017, already a mother of sorts, but
pregnant, the baby conveniently enclosed inside me. It’s from a photo
booth, taken at an immersive experience I’d taken Laney to, just us two,
in London, on the bus. Alice’s Adventures Underground. In the gif our
bodies move jerkily. In the images—I have two versions—we are grinning,
hugging, and pretty—there’s some kind of filter on it, that makes
freckles pop and cheek bones glow—the pictures of youth and naivete. I’m
wearing stripes, and we’re moving in time, in sync, twinning, Tweedledum
and Tweedledee.</p>
<p>The painted roses on the backdrop contain, on closer inspection
faces: mean, or pig-nosed, or dopey—the flowers know something we don’t.
The production had taken place in a vault somewhere, on the Southbank,
and afterwards passing St Thomas Hospital, where six months later I’d
give birth, I’d experienced a strange pre-resonance, a sense that
something would happen there that would change my life.</p>
<p>I find something poignant looking at that gif. I think it’s the
slowness of our movement in it. Cartoonish. And glitchy, buggy. As
though we are not quite catching on to our fate.</p>
<p>The speed with which Laney has grown up, grown beyond and away from
me, it’s thrilling, vertiginous, scary but there’s also something
nonsensical about it. Topsy turvy. I should be maturing at the same or
greater rate. I should be getting wiser, more selfless. Better at living
in the moment. So how is it she that is almost my height, who calms my
sister, who occupies my kids? Maybe when we emerged from the vault all
those years ago we’d swapped somehow. Like Alice, whose <em>Through the
Looking Glass</em> I’m now reading to my small kids. She goes through
the mirror and becomes her reflection. We’d drunken different
potions—she’d grown up, and I’d stayed small.</p>
<p>My aunt was older when she had me to stay than I will be when Laney
is 16, by ten years. I want Laney to know how much she is loved, and I
want to be with her when she experiences adulthood. But maybe what I’m
experiencing is a microdosing of a different sort, the pulling away. A
quarter of a tab of loss. Maybe she’s teaching me something new,
something that will be useful to me eventually. How to be weaned
off.</p>
