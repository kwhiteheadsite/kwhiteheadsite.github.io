            <h1>Editing</h1>
            <p>I am passionate about helping writers develop their stories.</p>
            <p>I was previously Commissioning Editor at 4th Estate, where I worked on a range of literary fiction and non-fiction, acquiring books by Lena Dunham, creator of HBO's <i>Girls</i>, and National Book Award longlistee T. Geronimo Johnson, among others.</p>
            <p>In 2023, I helped launch the short fiction site, <a href="https://cosmorama.site/">Cosmorama</a>, as Editor in Chief.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a reader for <a href="https://literaryconsultancy.co.uk/">The Literary Consultancy</a>, the UK's longest-established editorial consultancy, where I am also on the editorial committee.</p>
            <p>I have a particular interest in innovative female voices, but read widely across genres, and pride myself on meeting the writer wherever they are at.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>[Katy’s] skills as a reader and editor are unmatched in anything I’ve experienced in writing and publishing, and her ability to communicate her thoughts, critiques, and ideas is second to none… She became an adviser and a confidant. Her knowledge of the industry is thorough and she is a wealth of information and inspiration. When it comes to editing, she has the skills and experience to help turn a good story into a great story. She elevates the material while ensuring it retains its soul and voice.</p>
